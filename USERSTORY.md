User story: As a teacher, I want to specify a list of word pairs for my students to practice this week.

Example: A teacher can create text file containing the practice schedule, and students can import that file. They will be reminded by the application which word pair to practice.


User story: As a student working with a textbook, I want to load pairs of words to practice from each chapter of the book.

User story: As a student, I want the Sudoku app to keep track of the vocabulary words that I am having difficulty recognizing so that they will be used more often in my practice puzzles.

Example: Keep a list of words that the user is learning and the count number of times the user uses that word correctly or incorrectly.


User story: As a student who wants to practice my understanding of spoken words in the language that I am learning, I want a listening comprehension mode. In this mode, numbers will appear in the pre-filled cells.

Example: When a user presses the number, the corresponding word in the language that he/she is learning will be read out. The user can then test his/her listening comprehension by entering the English translation of the word into an appropriate puzzle cell.


User story: As a language learner, I want to be able to peek at the correct translation of a word, so that I can try to remember it in filling out the puzzle.

Example: When a user selects a Sudoku cell that is part of the pre-filled configuration of a puzzle, the translation of that word is momentarily displayed.
